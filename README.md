# Game Assets Repository

A simple folder structure for organizing game assets.

## Structure

```
models/     # 3D models (.obj, .fbx, .gltf, etc.)
textures/   # Images and texture files (.png, .jpg, .tga, etc.)
audio/      # Sound effects and music (.mp3, .wav, .ogg, etc.)
sprites/    # 2D sprites and UI elements (.png, .jpg, .svg, etc.)
```

## Usage

Simply drag and drop your assets into the appropriate folders:

- **models/**: Place your 3D model files here
- **textures/**: Store texture images and materials
- **audio/**: Keep sound files and music tracks
- **sprites/**: Organize 2D graphics and UI elements

## File Organization

Organize files by:
- Game feature (e.g., `models/characters/`, `models/environment/`)
- Asset type (e.g., `textures/diffuse/`, `textures/normal/`)
- Quality level (e.g., `audio/high/`, `audio/compressed/`)

This structure works with any game engine or development framework.
